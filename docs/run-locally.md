### Running Locally

- #### DOCKER (with step debugging)

  Run a docker-compose app that simulates the standard scenario of shibboleth-sp running in one space and a client app running elsewere.

  1. **Container A**: A lambda@edge simulator.
     The nodejs package that backs the lambda@edge origin request function will run in a container and be exposed to ones browser over port 5000.
  2. **Container B**: The targeted origin or "app".
     This will be something like wordpress or anything else that listens for https requests.
     Its port is not published and will only be accessible by container A over the internal docker network bridge *(as an origin typically would only be accessible by the lambda@edge function)*.

  With these two containers running, the cloud-based scenario is simulated to some degree in that all requests bound for container B must go through container A first to be inspected for tokens and proof of authenticated status with the shibboleth IDP.

  Container A is essentially a nodejs/express app acting as a reverse proxy with some "adapter" functionality applied.
  The "adapter" functionality allows container A to simulate cloudfront@edge, by transforming http requests from express into objects that conform to the [lambda@edge event structure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-event-structure.html#lambda-event-structure-request) before passing them in to the main lambda@edge nodejs artifact. Similarly, all response objects returned are converted back into regular http responses on their way back to the client.

  #### Steps to run

  1. **Install**
     From the root directory, install dependencies for the main module and all nested modules:

     ```
     npm install
     ```

  2. **Create .env file**:

     ```
     DOCKER_REGISTRY="037860335094.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com"
     ENTITY_ID="https://*.kualitest.research.bu.edu/shibboleth"
     IDP_CERT="<ds:X509Certificate> value from https://shib-test.bu.edu/idp/shibboleth goes here"
     ENTRY_POINT="https://shib-test.bu.edu/idp/profile/SAML2/Redirect/SSO"
     LOGOUT_URL="https://shib-test.bu.edu/idp/logout.jsp"
     APP_APPEND_AUTH_HEADERS="false"
     APP_AUTHORIZATION="true"
     APP_LOGIN_HEADER="SHIB-HANDLER"
     APP_LOGOUT_HEADER="SHIB_IDP_LOGOUT"
     DOCKER_APP_PORT="80"
     DOCKER_SP_PORT=5000
     SAML_CERT="-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
     MIIEGzCCAoOgAwIBAgIJAPhkIj1CZ3z3MA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUAMCcxJTAjBgNV
     BAMTHGlwLTEwLTU3LTIzNy0yMS5lYzIuaW50ZXJuYWwwHhcNMTYwODA4MDQyNzE4
     ...
     -----END CERTIFICATE-----"
     SAML_PK="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
     MIIG/gIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAASCBugwggbkAgEAAoIBgQDLQEgmPeVMBas1

     ...
     -----END PRIVATE KEY-----"
     ```
  
     Replace `SAML_CERT` and `SAML_PK` with the full values.
     *NOTE: The JWT keys do not need to be set here as they are arbitrary for running locally and will be auto-generated.*
     If you want to simply run the dockerized app, skip the remaining steps below and simply run:
  
     ```
     docker compose -f docker-compose-slim.yml up -d
     ```
  
     This will produce two "slim" docker files with only the tree-shaken js index files.
     Visit `https://localhost:5000.` in your browser.
     If instead you want step debugging, proceed as follows instead...
  
  3. **Build the project:**
     This is necessary to produce a dist folder that can be mapped to the corresponding containerized directory structure.
  
     ```
     npm run build
     ```
  
  4. **Run the docker-compose app:**
  
     The following command should build 2 images and run 2 containers *(container A, and container B as mentioned above).*
  
     ```
     docker compose up -d
     ```

  5. **Run "attach-to-docker-sp-process":**
     This vscode launch configuration should to attach to the container A *(the shibboleth-sp container)*. 
     This launch config maps the internal container directory `/sp` to the local `${workspace}` directory.
     As as long as these two directories mirror each other, including the dist folders, source mapping should work.
  
  6. **Browser:**
     Navigate to `https://localhost:5000.`
     You should see content output by container B, proxied by container A
  
  7. **Step debug:**
     While "attach-to-docker-sp-process" is running, you should be able to place a breakpoint into any code in scope (ie: src/HandlerSp.ts), refresh the browser, and observe excecution pause on the breakpoint.
  
  **SIMPLE LAUNCH CONFIGS:**
  You can also step debug by running either of two vscode launch configurations:
  
  - **sp-express-sp**
    Runs in isolation and mocks a dummy app, since non is running or reachable.
    Once running, it is reachable at `https://localhost:5000`
  - **sp-express-app**
    Runs in isolation and "pretends" requests have passed through a shibboleth-sp proxy.
    Once running, it is reachable at `https://localhost`
  
  Neither of these involve any docker usage.
